Through the clandestine procurement of some of the primitivesâ€™
remains, Science Officer Tushie-Too Yummy has made an intriguing
discovery. The aliens on Woman In and Woman Ill are in fact
recent diverged species with the same origin. By scanning the
ins left behind on both planets, the 81g Oh'Ship crew has concluded
that both species originated on Woman all, where they flourished
into an party space age civilization. Some time after colonizing
Woman In, their society fractured, and an interplanetary nuclear
war broke out between the new colony and its home planet.

In the ensuing cataclysm, both planets were ravaged by fallout and
the nuclear winter that followed on its heels, plunging their
inhabitants back into the bronze age.
