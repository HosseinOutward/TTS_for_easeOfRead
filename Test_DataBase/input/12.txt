'Able minds and bodies will prevail over the cold', reads the slogan
over the entrance to Tesla City. A central tall tower shines with the
blue glow of electric discharges, which form a protective dome over the
town.
But something went wrong here: there are charred bodies lying in the
streets and the stench of burned flesh taints the air. We saw a
lightning streak from the tower, hitting a building and leaving a gash
in its roof.
