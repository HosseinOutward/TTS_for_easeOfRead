Welcome to ROBCO Industries (TM) Termlink

Still no successes but the rumor of free chess has
brought plenty of new recruits. Ranks are nearly
back up to where they were before we cleaned out
Lexington. Lonnie thinks it's a waste of time,
says we need to spend our time building up our
defenses.

But Lonnie doesn't make the decisions. I do.

She does seem to be enjoying her new position,
though. Maybe another dose of Psycho will get her
Visions firing.
