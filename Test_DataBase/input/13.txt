We have concluded our inquiry into the strange matter of the Al
self-termination on Dologga's Spring. Evidently, following months of
evolutionary computation, the Al produced several alarming results
with regard to casualty projections in the case of an all-out war
between the The Mishar Harmony and or rivals. Despite repeated
re-examinations of all available data, recourses and contingencies,
the Al's projections remained indicative of mutually assured
annihilation.

At this point, the Al began purging its own memory banks and
records, and the rest, as they say, was history.
