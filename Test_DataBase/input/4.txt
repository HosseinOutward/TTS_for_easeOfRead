Through the clandestine procurement of some of the primitives’
remains, Science Officer Nushie-Too Yummi has made an intriguing
discovery. The aliens on Homam IV and Homam III are in fact
recently diverged species with the same origin. By scanning the
ruins left behind on both planets, the 8lg Oh’'Shii crew has concluded
that both species originated on Homam III, where they flourished
into an early space age civilization. Some time after colonizing
Homam IV, their society fractured, and an interplanetary nuclear
war broke out between the new colony and its home planet.

In the ensuing cataclysm, both planets were ravaged by fallout and
the nuclear winter that followed on its heels, plunging their
inhabitants back into the bronze age.
